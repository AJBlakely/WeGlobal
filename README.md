WeGlobal is a personal digital journal designed for travelers who want to keep a detailed record of their adventures. Instead of burying memories in a photo gallery, this app allows users to categorize their trips, note down specific accommodations, and save tips for future visits (or for friends!).

To handle the dynamic data and navigation of this app, I used:

HTML: Structured the multi-page layout and input forms.

CSS: Styled the interface for a clean, travel-inspired aesthetic.

JavaScript : Managed the application state, handled page transitions, and implemented the logic for adding, editing, and deleting entries.
